# This Repository Has Moved

**Tempest is now hosted on Codeberg:** https://codeberg.org/VintageTechie/cosmic-ext-applet-tempest

## Why?

GitHub is owned by Microsoft, and Microsoft uses hosted code to train AI models. I do not consent to my work being used for AI training.

I've moved all my projects to Codeberg, a non-profit, community-run Git hosting service based in Germany with strong privacy protections.

## For cosmic-flatpak users

The Flatpak will continue to work. The manifest will be updated to point to the new Codeberg repository.
